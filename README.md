### Questions to ponder !!

- After the relaxation of lockdown protocols, how often do you find the shops/malls with more people than there should be ?
- Don't you think that manually writing your details before entering a stop/mall is a tedious process ?
- How would like to have a virtual journal where you can record your visits outside on a daily basis ?

We, the team <b>Alpha Coders</b> have come up with an idea addressing these questions. We are happy to present <b>Alphere</b>, a brand of services that provides a nominal remedy to promote social distancing while shopping in a civic envionment and to fast track commuting details of individuals.
