# alphCapture

An improvised prototype of a system that enables monitoring of customers entering or leaving a shop.
- Uses AI imbibed face recognition system to mark the entry and exit instance of customers and updates count.
    - Prototype developed using Python and OpenCV  
    
  
For each face registered at the entry point, a count variable is set that increments till a particular limit.
When maximum limit is reached – alert send to staff<br>
Similarly, at exit point, the customer's face is registered and compared with the existing images in database.
If a match is found, customer count is decremented, and the the image is removed from the database.
